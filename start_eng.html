<h1>Welcome to the Port <br>of Oslo in 1798</h1>
<p>In the Port of Oslo in 1798 you can experience what it may have been like to explore Osloâ€™s harbour at the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>Using your smartphone you can explore the web experience. This is a series of 360&deg; pictures, 3D models and much more. We recommend that you do this when in the harbour area. You can also use VR goggles like Google cardboard.</p>
<p>If you're on a computer you can download the experience. This way you can explore in a full 3D environment.</p>
