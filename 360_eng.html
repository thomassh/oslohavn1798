<h1>Welcome to the Port <br>of Oslo in 1798</h1>
<p>You can explore the harbour on your computer, but you'll get the best experience with your smartphone (landscape mode) in Bj√∏rvika. You can also use VR-goggles like Google Cardboard.</p>
<p>In this 360-experience you'll find 3D models, movies, sounds and music, games and information about streets and buildings. Click the map icon for an overview of the area.</p>
