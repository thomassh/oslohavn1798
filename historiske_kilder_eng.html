<h1>The history</h1>
<p>The decades around the turn of the 19th century played an essential role in the formation of modern Norway. It was at this time that much of the foundations for the modern market economy, as well as present dayâ€™s democracy, were laid. New ideas and ideals connected to culture, aesthetics and social conduct spread, many of which are still with us today. In this project we use the <i>Port of Oslo in 1798</i> as an entrance to tell you more about these developments</p>
<p><i>The Port of Oslo in 1798</i> experiments with, and develops, new tools and methods making it easier for the public to access the multitude of historical sources which archives, libraries and museums have made available online. By linking from the digital world to references and further reading we hope that The Port of Oslo in 1798 can be an introduction to further exploration of these digital treasure troves (in Norwegian).</p>
